Project Description:

ECXi is a certification system. It has the admin panel where administrators upload the `.csv` file containing the `name` and `email` of students to be certified. When an intern visits the platform, he/she provides their email, a search is done on the database to confirm if the email exists. If it does, the corresponding name is inscribed on a certificate template that must have been uploaded to the server, after which the user can get it downloaded.

Admins can change the database simply by uploading another .csv file. When a new upload is done, the initial file gets discarded from the server.

The team looked forward to taking up a task that will benefit every intern. With this platform, every intern can get their certificate downloaded on their gadgets easily. We look forwad to working with the organisers to see how our app would be optimised for use for the internship.
